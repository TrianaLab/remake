## remake pull

Pull an artifact and print its content.

### Synopsis

Pull retrieves a Makefile artifact from the specified endpoint, which can be:
• An HTTP(s) URL pointing to a raw Makefile
• An OCI registry reference (e.g. oci://registry.example.com/repo:tag)
The command will cache downloaded artifacts under the configured cache directory to speed up
subsequent pulls. Use the --no-cache flag to bypass the cache and force a fresh download.
The content of the Makefile is printed to stdout for inspection or piping into other tools.

```
remake pull <endpoint> [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  # Pull a Makefile over HTTP
  remake pull https://example.com/Makefile

  # Pull a Makefile from an OCI registry
  remake pull oci://registry.example.com/myrepo:latest

  # Pull a Makefile without using cache
  remake pull --no-cache https://example.com/Makefile
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help       help for pull
      --no-cache   Force download and ignore cache
```
